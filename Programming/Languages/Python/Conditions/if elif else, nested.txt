if(condition): #if condition is true, run this code
	CODE HERE

elif(ANOTHER condtion): #if condition is true, run this code
	CODE HERE

else:  #if none is true, run this code
	CODE HERE


Example

weather = input("Enter your name: ")
if(weather == "clear"):
	print("Good to hear! The weather is clear.")

elif(weather == "sunny"):
	print("its sunny! Wear shorts and T shirts")

else:
	print("I dont know this condition!, try asking a friend.")



#You don't have to use elif or else, its an option, a code can could look
like this.

if(condition): #if condition is true, run this code
	CODE HERE

else(ANOTHER condtion): #if condition is true, run this code
	CODE HERE


#You can also use elif as many times as you need.




Nested if - אם מכונן
If inside of another if

example
if(age > 18):
	if(gender == male):
		print("Welcome in! No female allowed")



we can use if on a boolean without typing == true, for example
if rain:
	print("Don't forget your umbrella")
