Why isnt Python accurate when using float?
If we try to add 1.23 to 2.80, We get 4.0299999999
Instead of 4.03. Why?
As mentioned Python was wrote in C.
C uses a limited number of bits.
So how do we fix that?, 2 options.

divide by 100 (use int instead of float)
(123 + 280) / 100

Round(1.23 + 2.80, 2) - This function will round the first 
input, starting from the second input number after the dot.
