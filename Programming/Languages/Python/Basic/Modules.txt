Modules are sets of functions that we can add to our own code.
Before using a module, we have to import it.
import MODULENAME  #Generic import

For example
import random

Sometimes instead of importing the whole module, we only want a specific function.
In that case, we can use 
from random import FUNCTION'SNAME #Function inport
from random import randint

Instead of each time typing MODULENAME.FUNCTIONNAME, we can use universal import
from MODULENAME import *



Generic Import (import module)Use when you need access to multiple components of a module or when the module name itself is descriptive enough.
Universal Import (from module import function) Use when you only need one or a few specific functions, classes, or constants from a module to enhance code clarity and avoid namespace pollution.
