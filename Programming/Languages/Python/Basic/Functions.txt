def function_name():
	CODE HERE

def is used to create a function, and if we want to run it, we will have to use
the function's name followed by ()
function_name()

A function could also take a variable as an input, for example
def function_name(num):
	CODE HERE

This will allow us to use the variable inside the function.
We could also use return in the end of the function.
return(VALUE/VARIABLE)

Simple example
def add(num,num1):
	return(num + num1)
add(5,2)
OUTPUT:7
