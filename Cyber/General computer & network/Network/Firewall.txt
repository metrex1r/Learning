A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on set of rules.
it's essentially the barrier that sits between a private internal network and the public Internet.
A firewallâ€™s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.
For example, not allowing traffic on port 80.
