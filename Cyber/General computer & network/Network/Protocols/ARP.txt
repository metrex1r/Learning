ARP - Address Resolution Protocol, used in computer networks(Specificly IP). operates in the Layer 2 of the OSI model.
The main function of ARP is to map an IP address to a physical MAC address on a local network.

Here's how ARP works:

Address Resolution - When a device in a LAN wants to communicate, it first checks his dest ARP cache.
If the MAC address for the dest IP address is not found in the cache, the device initiates an ARP request.

ARP Request - The device broadcasts an ARP request packet , asking "Who has IP address X?".
ARP Reply - The device with the corresponding IP address sends an ARP reply packet containing its MAC address to the requester.
ARP Cache Update - Upon receiving the ARP reply, the requesting device updates its ARP cache with the IP-to-MAC address mapping.
Data Transmission - With the MAC address of the destination known, the original device can now encapsulate its data packets with the MAC address of the recipient and send them.

ARP operates within a single broadcast domain. Routers are responsible for ARP translation between different networks.

While ARP is a simple and efficient protocol, it's susceptible to various security vulnerabilities, such as ARP spoofing. 
To mitigate these risks, techniques like ARP cache poisoning detection and ARP inspection are employed in modern networks.
