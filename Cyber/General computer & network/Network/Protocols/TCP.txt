TCP protocol propeties
1. Dividing to Packets TCP breaks down data into manageable packets for efficient transmission.
These packets carry the information along the network and are reassembled at the destination.

2. Sequence Numbers (Seq) To ensure that packets arrive in the correct order, TCP assigns a sequence number to each packet.
This enables the receiver to reorder packets if necessary and reconstruct the original data stream accurately.

3. Acknowledgment (Ack) TCP implements acknowledgments to confirm that data has been successfully received.
If a sender doesn't receive an acknowledgment for a packet within a specified timeframe, it assumes the packet was lost and retransmits it.

4. Flow Control TCP employs flow control mechanisms to manage the rate of data transmission between sender and receiver, preventing overwhelming the recipient with data.
This ensures efficient and fair sharing of network resources.

5. TCP Handshake Before data transfer begins, TCP initiates a connection through a three-way handshake.
This involves SYN (synchronize), SYN-ACK (synchronize acknowledgment), and ACK (acknowledgment) messages exchanged between sender and receiver to establish a reliable connection.

6. Keep Alive TCP includes a mechanism for detecting idle connections and maintaining them by periodically sending small packets known as keep-alives.
These packets prevent network devices from prematurely closing connections due to inactivity.

7. Checksum To guarantee data integrity, TCP calculates a checksum for each packet.
This checksum is a mathematical sum derived from the packet's contents, which the receiver uses to verify that the data hasn't been corrupted during transmission.
