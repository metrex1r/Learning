HTTP
HTTP is a protocol for transferring data online, commonly used for web browsing on port 80.
It works like TCP as it sends requests from clients (like web browsers) to servers and gets responses back.
However, unlike TCP, HTTP is focused on web communication and operates on a stateless model, treating each request independently.
The client target is to make internet requests, GET, POST, PUT, Delete.
This means HTTP uses TCP as transport protocol.
