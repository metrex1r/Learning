protocol - a system of rules that explain the correct conduct and procedures to be followed to communicate.
Different protocols define what we want to do and how.
Headers -  describe the data, what IP do we send it to? who sent it?, whats the theme? etc...
Data - what do we want to share.

Protocol Binary - transmit data in binary form, meaning the data is represented using only two digits, typically 0s and 1s.
Efficiency and speed are paramount, as binary data can be processed faster by machines compared to text-based data.
Binary protocols are often more compact and have less overhead than text-based protocols because they don't include human-readable characters.
The protocol looks like this:
code   user id   date   message
1 b     2 byte  2 byte  3 byte
b - byte
Protocol Textology -  analysis of text in digital form, such as natural language processing.
