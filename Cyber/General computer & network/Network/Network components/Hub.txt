Hub - רכזת
Barely in use anymore, old component, Doesnt really do anything beside copy paste.
The hub is connected for x amount of computers.
Getting a msg from computer y and copy the msg and pasting it to computers a,b,c(all computers).
It is located on the physical level, doesnt has an IP or know addresses.
Also doesnt edit any packets.	

The problem with the hub is lack of privacy, it is sending the msg to everyone
(unless its encrypted). Another problem that is if 2 devices sends a msg at the same
time, both of the msgs will get scrambled and be sent together.

Colition space - the space that the colition can happened and the msg will get scrambled.
Broadcast space - the space that the broadcast is being transmitted from.
