Switch - מתג doesnt edit packets or has ip address.
Works on the 2nd layer of the OSI model - know how to read MAC addresses.
When a computer send a msg, it will only send the msg to the destenation using MAC address table.
MAC address - switch port number. For example:
A address - port 1.
B address - port 2.
C address - port 3.
The switch reads each msgs outer layer(MAC ADDRESS).
So the switch check which port does the specific mac is located and sends there the msg.

How does the switch knows how to build this table if we could change the devices each time?
The switch has learning process with 3 steps.
1.Learning - look at the source address and check if it's updated, if not it's updating the table.
2.Forwarding/floding - checks if it recognize the dest address in the table.
	if it know then send it to the dest.
	if it doesnt, send to everyone(like hub). then the dest will get it and respond, after the
	dest will respond, the table will be updated and address would be recognized.
3.Updat e - if a MAC address didnt talk in a while, delete from the table.
