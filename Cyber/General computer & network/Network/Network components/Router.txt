A router - a device in computer networking that connects multiple computer networks together and directs traffic between them.
It operates at the third layer of the OSI model. 


Functions of a Router

Packet Forwarding - Primary function of a router is to forward data packets from one network to another. 
When a router receives a packet, it examines the destination IP address and determines the best path to forward the packet.

Routing Table - Routers maintain a routing table, which contains information about available routes and their associated network addresses. 
This table helps the router make decisions about where to send packets based on their destination addresses.

Network Address Translation (NAT) - translating private IP addresses used within a local network into a single public IP address for communication over the internet.
This helps conserve IP addresses and adds a layer of security by hiding internal network structure.

Traffic Filtering and Security - Routers can filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on various criteria such as IP addresses, ports, or protocols. 
This capability allows routers to enforce security policies and protect networks from malicious activity.

How Routers Work:

Packet Switching - When a router receives a packet, it examines the destination IP address and check the routing table to determine the best path for forwarding the packet. It then encapsulates the packet in a new frame with the appropriate MAC address for the next hop and forwards it to the outgoing interface.

Routing Algorithms - Routers use routing algorithms to determine the best path for forwarding packets. 
These algorithms consider factors such as network topology, link bandwidth, and hop count to select the most efficient route.

Address Resolution - Before forwarding a packet, a router may need to perform address resolution to determine the MAC address of the next hop.
It uses protocols like ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to map IP addresses to MAC addresses on the local network.

Packet Forwarding Decisions - Routers make forwarding decisions based on the destination IP address of packets.
They use techniques like longest prefix matching to find the most specific route in the routing table that matches the destination address.
