Change mac address

#1 Check your interface name by using this command
ifconfig

#2 Disable it by the next command

##wlan0 is just an example use the inteface you want to use

#3 Now to change it you need to type "ifconfig wlan0", the thing you want to change and what you want it to be changed to
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55

##hw stands for hardware
##make sure you address start with "00"

#4 make sure you don't forget to enable your interface back on my this command
