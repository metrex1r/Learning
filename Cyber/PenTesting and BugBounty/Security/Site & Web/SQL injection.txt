Almost all the solutions are bypassable the best one is to sperarte the data and the code.
for example:

dangerous code:
Select * from accounts where username='$textbox1'

safe code:
perpare("Select * from accounts where username = "?")
execute(array('$textbox1'))

If we do that then the sql will know its a value and not a code

Also use filters, blacklist/whitelist proxy
