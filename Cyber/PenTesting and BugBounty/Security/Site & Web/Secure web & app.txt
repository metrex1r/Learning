1. Write a secure code which cant be exploited by hackers, the developers need to know the
methods that hackers use and how to prevent them.
Disatvantage: some of the code usually 3rd party code which means we didnt write the code.

2.Code review, make other developers review your code in case we missed anything.
Disatvantage: expensive, code size.

3.Try to pentest your own code, hire a team to pentest your website.
Disatvantage: expensive, not future proof.

4.Bug bounty, all ethical hackers will try to pentest your application and only those who
find a exploit will get paid. as long as the bug bounty is live, this is future proof.
Disadvantage: hard to manage, cant guarantee full coverage.
