start zenmap by typing zenmap at the terminal or start it as a app

After youve scanned the desigred device for example intesnse scan, look at the data.
when looking at the services and open ports go port after port and search the name of the program and versions on google.
and then search for any vulners. 

for example: lets scan our metasploit machine, first output is a ftp service ftp is a service which allow you to upload things
from your remote server. for example if its miscounfigured and allow anon login then you can simply need to download ftp client and login.

lets take another example port 512/tcp exec netkit-rsh rexecd, lets pretend we dont what it is ( i have no idea what it is, fr).
first search it up at google, ive found it is a remote execution program, it use the "rsh login" it is simmlar to ssh and it lets you execute remote commands,
on target machine. now search how can we connect to it, search "netkit-rsh" or the version followed by exploit, we can see its ubuntu package that used to connect the server, install it and check the commadnds for it.
then simply connect to the target machine with the package commands. this means you have access  to remote execution program!

So what are we exactly looking for??
misconfuiguratons, defualt passwords, backdoors  or a code executions

What to search on google?

Service name + version + exploit
Service name 
etc
