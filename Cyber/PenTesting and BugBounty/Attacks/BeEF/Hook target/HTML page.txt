Defualt username: beef
Password: as you set as you first open BeEF

Launch beef from apps by searching "beef start"

Online browsers - Browsers which hooked to beef which you can control
Offline browsers - Browsers that you previously were able to control

In order to hook a browser to BeFF and be able to control it and run commands on it,
You have to get the browser run a specific JS code. Go to the terminal that opened when we ran beef,
If you scroll up you will find the example code. You will be able to show fake updates and gain full control over target sys.
Copy the JS code and go to web root by either pressing ctrl + l or go to /var/www/html.
Right click on index.html and open it with text editor, Remove everything in the file and paste the hook code.
Modify the ip of the hook code and set it to our kali machine ip or if it is a remote target set it to the kali's public ip.
Open the terminal and type:
service apache2

Now we have the webserver running and if anyone connects to the page, He will be hooked to our beef.
From there we can run useful commands on our target.

Once stopping using beef search beef stop in search bar, to stop beef from running in the background.
