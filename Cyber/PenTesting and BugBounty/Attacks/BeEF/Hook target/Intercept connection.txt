We can inject JS code if we are the man in the middle.
We can inject BeFF JS code in every website the target loads.
This will allow to keep them hooked without directly communicating with them.

First edit the inject_beef.js and set your IP in the domain and save the file,
Now our JS code is ready and we just have to inject it by using hstshijack caplet.
To do it go to the location of the hstshijack caplet,
user -> local -> share -> bettrecap -> caplets -> hstshijack -> hstshijack.cap
Now modify the file so the payload website is * (every website) followed by the location of the JS code,
For example lets locate our file at root and set this code

set hstshijack.payloads        *:/root/inject_beef.js

Now all we need to do is to run MITM attack and using the hsts caplet.
