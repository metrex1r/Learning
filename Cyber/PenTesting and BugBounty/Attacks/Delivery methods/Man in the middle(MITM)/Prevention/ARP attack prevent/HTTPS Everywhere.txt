The data will go thru the adming/hacker but do we really care if it is encrypted?
no, if the data is encrypted it does not matter it is useless.
https is encrypted data, if we use a https everywhere plugin it will add security aon https supported site.

it will force us to use https but it is still not perfect, if you access a website which use only http, then
the hacker can still see your information and will be stil able to do same things.

when using the plugin the hacker still can see the sites youre connected to but cant see the data.
to be more secure cover all the security folder specially this folder " arp attack prevent ".
