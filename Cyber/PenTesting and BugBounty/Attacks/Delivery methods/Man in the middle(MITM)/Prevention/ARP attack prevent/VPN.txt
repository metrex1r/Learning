VPN using an encrypted tunnel to send your information,
instead direct connection, you create encrypted tunnel to your vpn server 
and cause of the tunnel is encrypted then it doesnt matter if someone sees this data.
it covers all of the disadvantage in https everywhere. 

You need to be carful with your vpn provider, they  have access to all of your information.
pick trusted vpn provider, make sure thwy keep no logs and use https everywhere so the vpn provider cant see or data or some of it.
