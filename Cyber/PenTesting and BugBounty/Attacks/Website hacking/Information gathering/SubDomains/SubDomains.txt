It is important to search for any others subdomains, they can give us a lot of other information.
One of the ways to do that is with a app called knock follow this steps:
Open a terminal:
Knockpy google.com(target website)
this will try to brute force discover subdomains to the webserver, we can try to attack any of them.

Now for the fun part, discovering senstive files we are using a tool called dirb,
This works by searching for more directories in the website by brute forcing the wesite url.
We need a wordlist for that use this command for info:
man dirb

After scanning, if we found some pages, we can go one by one and read the files and check for information.
