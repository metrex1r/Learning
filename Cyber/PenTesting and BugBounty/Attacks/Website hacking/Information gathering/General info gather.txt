We can attack a webserver like any other machine, by getting the ip.

First when trying to attack or gather information on a website, search for logs and lookup tools.
Just google domain tools
For example netcraft.com.

You can see the webserver the might have exploits, host, country, organsation, hosting history, 
check for spam, web trackers(third party), site technology(most important), blog.

Lets take an example, 
Server side - Technology - PHP this means that the website can run and understand PHP code.
This means that if we run any attack this should be on a PHP code.
Client side - JS - This means that if you manage to run JS code on the website, it wont execute it on the website,
but the user who sees the website
Netcraft will show you any web application, we can check for vulners in those.
Literaly just go for each section and search for vulners and exploits.

Now look for DNS information, we are going to use robtex.com.
You can also see a lot of information there, for example you can send fake email as the server provider,
for new policies or whatever and add your backdoor or tell them to log in with fake login page.

If you are not able to hack the website the next step will be,
look for other websites on the same server, try to hack them and
you will be able to the server, both of the sites.

On robtex DNS lookup go to "names pointing to same IP" section, this will show all the websites on the same server.
if will be able to hack any of them, you will get access to all of them.
Another way to find websites on the same domain is using bing, open bing and search
ip:192.168....
