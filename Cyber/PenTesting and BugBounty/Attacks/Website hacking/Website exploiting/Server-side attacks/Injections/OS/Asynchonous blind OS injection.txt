Sometimes even if we have a blind injection, the injection will
be run on a new thread. this means that if we try to "sleep+5" -
check if the server is vulnerable, nothing will change even if the
command works.

A better way to check if the target server is vulner is inject a command
that will make the server ping your own server or connect to it.
If the target server has pinged your server, this means the target 
server is vulnerable.(Look at the server's logs)
