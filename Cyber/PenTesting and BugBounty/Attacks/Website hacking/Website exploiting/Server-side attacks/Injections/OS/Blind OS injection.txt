In some cases, the server will be vulnerable to the exploit
but will not show us the results of the commands.

A way to see if it works is to run the sleep command.
it will stop the server for x seconds from responding.
in HTML we will right "sleep+5".

BUT instead of just trying everything, we can use the intruder
with the cheatsheet.
