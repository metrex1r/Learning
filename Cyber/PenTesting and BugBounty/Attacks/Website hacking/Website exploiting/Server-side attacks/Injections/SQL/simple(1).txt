Try to break each page, Whenever you see something like that:
https://target.com/page.php?something=something
Try to edit that to change the page and break it, try to insert any code.
Using 'and', 'order by' or "'".
1=1 means true, # or -- means comment out

POST,GET sql injection discovering.

POST

This is the original code
Select * from accounts where username = '' and password ='INPUT'

if we set the password as, 123456' or 1=1#, then it will look like this:
Select * from accounts where username = 'admin' and password ='123456' or 1=1#'
Than 1=1 is true so it might grant us access.

We can also try to comment out the password.
Set the name as, admin' #             it will look like:
Select * from accounts where username = 'admin'#' and password =''
it will comment out the password part and should grant access.

We can also try(as the name), admin' order by 1#
Select * from accounts where username = 'admin' order by 1#' and password ='INPUT'
This will tell the server that we want to order the results based of the first collum.
If we want to know how many collums are there,
use order by and higher number everytime until you get an error,
Whic tell you this collum doesnt exist.



Try just playing with the code.

GET

We can do the same thing but in the url, something is the input and variable
https://target.com/page.php?something=something

But when using GET we have to use url encode,

*in every input enter a statement that true and ANOTHER that false and compare the results!
* -- means comment
