Making some kind of request, and using burp 
we can notice that sometimes the server is making another 
request to other server on X address.

Someimes, we cant communicate with X address server directly,
We can only communicate thru the first server brecause the X
server has a protection layer.

We could try to change the X server using burp suite, if it 
does work, we can make the server do something it doesnt designed 
to do.

For example changing the X server to http://localhost/
This will only change the X server to the first server.
so the server will send a request to itself.
Because we didnt specify a port, we are running whatever
server is on port 80 on the same machine.

If the server's behaviour is diffrent and the website loaded
itself, this means the server is vulnerable to SSRF attacks.

From there, you can ask the server to open an admin page etc
