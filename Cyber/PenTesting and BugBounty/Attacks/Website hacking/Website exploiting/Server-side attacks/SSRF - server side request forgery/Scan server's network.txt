If the server is vulnerable to a SSRF, we can manipulate the value
and try to connect to the same network's  devices.

For example, changing 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.2 and see if there is 
a device on this ip.

To brute force it, we shall use burp suite
Use the intruder command and highlight the part of the address we want to change
 192.168.0.*1*

Set the payload as numbers from 1 to 254 as sequential
