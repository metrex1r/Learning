Sometimes when you have the server do something for you, for example ping test or
anything that requires the terminal, some pats of the url will change to your input.
It can be anything as 
web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?ip=INPUT/1
web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?cmd=INPUT/1
web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input=INPUT/1

This url-input can be used as same as the input vulner.
So for example:
web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input=INPUT; pwd/1


Another thing, when browsing the websrver looking for stuff, always look at the url for example,
We enountered any page with part of "example/mainpage/ping/page=x/" this means the webserver opened this other page.
So we are going to look for this file by remove everything and type the other page name for example,
web.com/example/mainpage/ping/x/
web.com/example/mainpage/x/
web.com/example/x/
web.com/x/

Now either this page open or we got error not found or the file isnt working properly, if the file isnt working properly
it might give you an error with the full location go to that path and try accessing directories ,for example,
error: var/www/web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input=INPUT/1/x
to access it, web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input=/../../../../../etc/passwords
So now if the file exist, we accessed the passwords!
