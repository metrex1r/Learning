If the websites alow uploads, We can try to exploit this so the server will execute the backdoor.
But we need that the code will be readable for the server, We can know what code is readable,
By the information gathering section. This means that if the server is only reading PHP files,
The backdoor should be as PHP. Create the backdoor using weevely, upload it to the website.

Now check if the backdoor has been installed properly, go to the folder where it should be. For example:
10.20.13/dvwa/pictures/shell.php
If we dont get error 404/Page not found this means the file is there waiting for us,
else this means we either in the wrong file or we didnt upload it properly.

Now try to interact with weevely as showen in the backdoor file.





Soulotion:
Allow only safe files to be uploaded, make sure its the right file format.
You can also use filters.
