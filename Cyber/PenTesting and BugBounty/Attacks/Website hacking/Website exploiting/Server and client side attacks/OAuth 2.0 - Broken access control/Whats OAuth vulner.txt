OAuth 2.0 vulner is broken access control vulner.
The best way to check if the server is vulnerable is..

Make two acccounts and see if we can access information from the second account
using the first account or log in as the second account using information or
the token of the first account.

For example, when getting the 200 response and the token, trying to change
the gmail for other gmail account and getting their token.
