#1
Sometime, we stumble upon a vulner GET request.
We would try to modify the get path to a senstive file.
BUT the file we want to get is a .txt and the server is expecting a jpg/png... etc
(There is a filter that accept only .jpg files)
We could use %00
for example
../../../etc/passwd%00.jpg

This will make the server think the file is jpg and the server will accept the request.
BUT the %00 will delete what comes after it and execute only the first part(../../../etc/passwd)

#2
The server might try also to filter the ../ request
So there is a simple solution, we can replace the ../ with ....//
After the filter it will look like that
....//....//....//etc/passwd -> ../../../etc/passwd

#3
Always try to keep the exploit as simple as possible.
Try to change as little as we can for example.
/var/www/images/1.jpg
If we get this address, instead of entirely changig it...
/var/www/images/../../../etc/passwd

#4
Another filter might even filter for example the  "/"
Soo, we can try to convert it to URL encode
IN BURP WE DO IT BY SELECTRING THE STRING -> RIGHT CLICK -> CONVERT SELECTION -> URL-ENCODE ALL CHARACTER
for example / = %2F
%2Fvar%2Fwww%2Fimages%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd

#5
Step 4 also might be filtered, the server might encode aswell and check if we did that.
In this case, We can try to double url encode it.
so we select the %2F from the previous example and reencode it
so %2F = %252F
the server will deencode the %252F to %2F

%252F..%252F..%252F..%252Fetc%252Fpasswd -> %2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
