If we stumble uppon a website with the need to change a value a lot,
instead of changing the value at every request, we can...
Go to options, scroll to match and replace, Add.
set match and replace, for example:
match: Admin=false
replace: Admin=true


HTTP history,
Before trying to exploit the website, we always want to try and browse
like a normal user. When going by a login page or a senstive page, we 
should check our HTTP history to try understand how does the page works.


Tick the intercept response in the settings to get the responses.
