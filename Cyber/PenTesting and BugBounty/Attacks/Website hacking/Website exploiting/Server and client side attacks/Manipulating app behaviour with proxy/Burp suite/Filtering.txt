The target tab has a site map, and it analyzes every request we have runned.
We can filter to search in all the data specific parameters if needed or some
kind of inputs.

We can also use regex to find hidden endpoints. After we have done testing,
we should search for ?xxxx=
xxxx means basically anything, we want it to start with a ? and end with a =.
, so how to do it in regex?
In the filtering we have a regex box, tick that on.
And then enter \?.*?=

. means we want to much any type of character and * means any amount any of characters.
the ? in regex can be used to stop matching by the end of the line, but we just want
a regular expression, so we added a back slash before. And thats aslso the reason we
added a regex ? before the =.

After getting the requests, we can use the same pattern to get the same values
in the request itself.
