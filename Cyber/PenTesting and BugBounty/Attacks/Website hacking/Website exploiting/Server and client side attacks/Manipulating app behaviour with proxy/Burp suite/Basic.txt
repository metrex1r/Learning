Whenever trying to manipulate the data that is being sent to the server,
there some things that happenning that we cannot see.
If we want to dicover it, we have to use a proxy server and analyze that data.
We can use burp suite to do that

First open a project
Click on proxy -> make sure intercept is on
Click on open browser and go to your website

The request will get stuck and your pc will not reply
You can see the packet in the burp suite and decide what to do.
You can manipulate the data before sending it and search vulners in the data.

*remember every value you see after an = sign, will be sent to the web application
(can be used to find vulners).

A basic example would  be changing the admin value to true at each request.
Another example is changing  your id with another user's id.
