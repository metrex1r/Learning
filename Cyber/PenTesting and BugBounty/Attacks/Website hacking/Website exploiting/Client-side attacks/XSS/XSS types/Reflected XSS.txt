Lets assmue there is a xss vulner at an input box
This means we can inject xss code into it
Lets try to run simple script for example type in the input box
<script>alert('XSS')</script>

If your browser got an alert saying XSS this means the input box is vulnerable
You can do the same at the url
You can also run any kind of js code(xss)

Now you can send the link to someone and the code will run
