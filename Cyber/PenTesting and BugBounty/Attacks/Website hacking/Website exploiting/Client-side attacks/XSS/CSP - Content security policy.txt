CSP is a feature that prevents XSS and other attacks.
When intercepting, if you see
"Content-security-policy:.....Script-src 'self'...;"
This tells the web to not run any JS code.

You can overwrite this by setting a new elment
"script-src-elem 'unsafe-inline'"

Instead of trying to directly change it, if there is
another variable at the line such as token that you
can manipulate using an input, try this first.
