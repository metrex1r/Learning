XSS allows the attacker to inject JS code into the page.
The javascript is a client side language, the code will be
only executed on the client machine(not the server).
XSS happens when there are not enough filters or the page wasnt coded right.

There are three types of XSS vulners:

Reflected XSS - Send a link with the code to the target.
Presistent/Stored XSS - The code will be stored in the page.
DOM based XSS - No logs, no filters, no server side protection.
	Nothing goes to the web server.

Stored XSS happenes when the server saves your input, for example
a review.



Also sometimes some variable isnt being shown, we could use burp 
to find them, and add them to the link.
EXAMPLE
link:
https://web.net/product?productId=2

BURP:
productId=1&storeId=London

MODIFIED LINK
https://web.net/product?productId=2&storeId=London
