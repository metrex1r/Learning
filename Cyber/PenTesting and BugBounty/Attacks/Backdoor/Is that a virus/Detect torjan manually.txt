First if  you open a non trusted image or any file that isnt executable, make sure it is not an exe by right click,
Go to propteies and then, make sure the type of the file is as it say it is. Go to details and 
make sure the type is also an image or that type of file.

Open resuource monitor by searching at the search bar -> Network tab -> TCP connection
You will be able to see all of the open ports in your machine

The suspicous part we are looking for is the remote address, for example it claims to be a website
we could check it by pasting the ip at our browser and if it is a website it should navigate us to the website.
Else, it is not what it claims to be... it is an attacker. To verify it we can use reverse DNS lookup, it will tell you
what websites a specific IP belongs to
