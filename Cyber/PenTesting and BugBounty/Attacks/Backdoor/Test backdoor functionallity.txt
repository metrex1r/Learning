Kali comes with a webserver and this means you can use it as a website.
We are gonna put the backdoor in this website, download it to the target windows machine.
Website directory:
/var/www/html/

Create a dir which called:
"Evil-files"
So we can test it everytime, paste the backdoor inside the file.

Now start the website by
service apache2 start
the website located on kali machine ip + folder name(Evil-files)
for example
192.168.1.12/Evil-files

Download and run it, check if we recive a connection from the target machine at kali.
Now if we did it means it worked well, and we have full control.
