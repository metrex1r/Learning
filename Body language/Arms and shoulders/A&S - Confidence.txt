Shoulders back, postured - high confidence
Shoulders forward - low confidence

Arms close to the body - something wrong, they dont feel good, protected or confidence.
Arms away from the body - feel safe, they dont need to protect themselve.
For example, people who dont like each other might hug each other with the elbows tucked.
