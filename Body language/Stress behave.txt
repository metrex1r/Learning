Stress can affect our body language a lot.
When we are stressed we will try to protect our body/calming ourselves.
For example when talking about a subjuect we are not comfortable talking about
or we just dont feel calm we tend to close our body like cross our arms/legs/cover vulnerable body parts.
(eyes, ears etc)

When someone is nervous or stressed, he wants to move - he wants to usually cant do it by words
and want to relive his body.

When talking to someone and there is some kind of barrier for example a pillow he is holding or
a bag/ anything that between you two. you have to get rid of that, but do it smoothly. Make him
feel nice and comfortable. For example tell him to sit some place else or go take something, try
to gid rid of the barrier nicely.
