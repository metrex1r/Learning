When having eye contact, we can feel some kind of connection. Be aware how much a person looks at you.
Observe when the person break eye contact with you, there is a few reasons for that.
The person just has to look for some place else(Cognitive action), for example look at the door whe openning.
When doing this he cant think anymore on you simultaneously. Other explaination,
that person wants to go to the direction he is looking at.
Whatever he is looking at is more imporatant than you are. If he is looking some place most of the time,
thats probably the direction he wants to go.If its just a short break, its probably just a cognitive action.

Same thing happens with torso\head\feet direction.
