Covering our mouth - we do this movment when we said something our brain doesnt want us to say.
People usually wont do that with their hand cause its too obvious but for example when a kid
lies they wont realize and might do it. It also might be because we hear someone saying
something inappropriate for that moment or thats a lie or thats something that no one supposed
to know. Covering our mouth might be in any way for example rubbing the nose.
