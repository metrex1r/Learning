Theory of outer contact - when we are in stress or nervous, we have to soothe ourselves.
Some theories says that we are soothing ourselves like our moms did to us. and thats
the reason we are touching our shoulders, cross our hands(like a hug) and those type
of movments which increase outer contact like the soother when we were young touches 
us. so when a person touches himself like that, he needs to soothe himself. you might
find the reason or you might not, but be aware that something went wrong at that moment.
